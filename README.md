This application is used internally at Olery for the Mario Kart Double Dash
Competition.

## MarioKart Experience Index
The score for the competition is measured with the MarioKart Experience
Index (MKEI).
The formula of this score is `(score / max_score) * 100` where:
* score is the amount of points in total (`amount of players - position`)
* max_score is the maximum amount of point available (`games * (amount of players
- 1)`).
